        "1. What is a random variable in probability theory?\n",
        "ans1)A random variable is just a way to assign numbers to outcomes of a random process. Think of it like this: if you flip a coin, you can say Heads = 1 and Tails = 0 — now you've turned a random event into a number. That’s your random variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What are the types of random variables?\n",
        "a-2)There are two main types:\n",
        "\n",
        "Discrete: Values you can count (like 0, 1, 2...).\n",
        "\n",
        "Continuous: Values you measure, like height or time — basically, any number in a range.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Difference between discrete and continuous distributions?\n",
        "a3)Discrete distributions deal with specific, countable outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Continuous distributions deal with a whole range of possible values — you’re more likely to talk about a range than a specific number.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What are probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n",
        "a4)A PDF (Probability Distribution Function) helps us understand the likelihood of a random variable taking on certain values. For discrete variables, we use PMFs (Probability Mass Functions), and for continuous ones, PDFs.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. How is a CDF different from a PDF?\n",
        "ans5)A CDF tells you the probability that a value is less than or equal to a certain number. A PDF (or PMF for discrete) just tells you the probability at a specific value. So CDFs show accumulated probability.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What’s a discrete uniform distribution?\n",
        "ans 6)It’s when all outcomes are equally likely. Like rolling a fair die — every number from 1 to 6 has the same chance.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Key properties of a Bernoulli distribution?\n",
        "ans7)Only two possible outcomes: success (1) or failure (0).\n",
        "\n",
        "Controlled by one parameter: the probability of success (usually called p).\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the binomial distribution used for?\n",
        "ans 8)It helps you figure out the probability of getting a certain number of successes in a fixed number of tries — like how many times you’ll get heads in 10 coin flips.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What’s the Poisson distribution and where is it used?\n",
        "9.Poisson is used for counting how often an event happens in a fixed interval — like how many emails you get per hour or how many people visit a website per day.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What’s a continuous uniform distribution?\n",
        "10.This is where every value within a range is equally likely — for example, if you randomly pick a number between 0 and 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What are the characteristics of a normal distribution?\n",
        "11.It’s the classic bell curve!\n",
        "\n",
        "Symmetrical, with most values around the center (the mean).\n",
        "\n",
        "Mean = median = mode.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What’s the standard normal distribution? Why is it important?\n",
        "12.It’s a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It’s important because we use it as a reference when we calculate Z-scores and compare data.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What’s the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and why does it matter?\n",
        "13.The CLT says that if you take enough samples from any population, the average of those samples will look like a normal distribution. This is super useful because it lets us make predictions even if the original data isn't normal.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. How is the CLT connected to the normal distribution?\n",
        "14.It’s what makes the normal distribution so powerful — thanks to CLT, the normal distribution pops up everywhere, especially in averages and totals.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How do we use Z-statistics in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "15.Z-statistics help us test if our sample result is significantly different from what we expect. It tells us how many standard deviations our sample is from the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. How do you calculate a Z-score, and what does it mean?\n",
        "16.Use the formula:\n",
        "\n",
        "𝑍=𝑋−𝜇/𝜎\n",
        "\n",
        "It tells you how far (in standard deviations) a value is from the mean. A Z-score of 2 means the value is 2 SDs above the average.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are point estimates and interval estimates?\n",
        "17.Point estimate: A single guess of a value (like the average height of 50 students).\n",
        "\n",
        "Interval estimate: A range that likely contains the true value (like saying the average height is between 160–170 cm).\n",
        "\n",
        "18. Why are confidence intervals important?\n",
        "18.They give us a way to say “We’re X% sure the true value is between here and there.” Much more reliable than a single number!\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What’s the link between Z-scores and confidence intervals?\n",
        "19.We use Z-scores to figure out the margins of a confidence interval. For example, a 95% confidence interval uses a Z-score of about 1.96.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. How do Z-scores help us compare different distributions?\n",
        "20.Z-scores put different data on the same scale. So even if two sets of data have different means and spreads, we can still compare values fairly.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What are the assumptions for the Central Limit Theorem?\n",
        "21.The samples should be independent.\n",
        "\n",
        "The sample size should be reasonably large (n > 30 is a good rule).\n",
        "\n",
        "The data should come from the same distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What’s the expected value in a probability distribution?\n",
        "22.Think of it as the “average outcome” you’d expect if you repeated an experiment many times.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does a probability distribution connect to expected value?\n",
        "23.The expected value is basically the “center” of the distribution — it tells us where the outcomes tend to land, based on their probabilities.\n",
